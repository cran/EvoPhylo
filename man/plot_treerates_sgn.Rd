\title{
Plot Bayesian evolutionary tree with rate thresholds for selection mode
}
\description{
Plots the summary Bayesian evolutionary tree with branches, according to user-defined thresholds (in units of standard deviations) used to infer the strength and mode of selection.
}
\usage{
plot_treerates_sgn(tree, posterior, clock = 1,
       summary = "mean", threshold = c("1 SD", "2 SD"),
       drop.dummyextant = TRUE,
       low = "blue", mid = "gray90", high = "red",
       branch_size = 2, tip_size = 2,
       xlim = NULL, nbreaks = 10, geo_size=list(2, 3),
       geo_skip = c("Quaternary", "Holocene", "Late Pleistocene"))
}
\arguments{
  \item{tree}{
A \code{tidytree} object; the output of a call to \code{\link[treeio:read.mrbayes]{treeio::read.mrbayes}}.
}
  \item{posterior}{
A data frame of posterior parameter estimates including a "clockrate" column indicating the base of the clock rate estimate for each generation that will be used for pairwise t-tests. Such data frame can be imported using \code{\link{combine_log}} (no need to reshape from wide to long). See the \code{\link{posterior1p}} or \code{\link{posterior3p}} datasets for an examples of how the input file should look.
}
  \item{clock}{
The clock number to plot, (i.e., the number in "rate<clockmodel>Brlens\{#\}_mean"). Ignored if only one clock is available.
}
  \item{summary}{
The rate summary to plot, (i.e., the value in "rate<clockmodel>Brlens1_\{summary\}"). Only "mean" and "median" are allowed. Default is "mean".
}
  \item{threshold}{
A vector of threshold values. Default is to display thresholds of ±1 relative standard deviation (SD) of the relative posterior clock rates. Should be specified as a number of standard deviations (e.g., \code{"1 SD"}) or the confidence level for a confidence interal around the mean relative posterior clockrate (e.g., \code{"95\%"}). Multiple values are allowed to produce a plot with multiple thresholds. Set to \code{NULL} to omit thresholds.
}
  \item{drop.dummyextant}{
\code{logical}; whether to drop the "Dummyextant" tip (if present) from the tree before plotting the tree. Default is \code{TRUE}.
}
  \item{low, mid, high}{
Colors passed to \code{\link{scale_color_steps2}} to control the colors of the branches based on which thresholds are exceeded. When no thresholds are supplied, use \code{mid} to control the color of the tree.
}
  \item{branch_size}{
The thickness of the lines that form the tree.
}
  \item{tip_size}{
The font size for the tips of the tree.
}
  \item{xlim}{
The x-axis limits. Should be two negative numbers (though the axis labels will be in absolute value, i.e., Ma).
}
  \item{nbreaks}{
The number of interval breaks in the geological timescale.
}
  \item{geo_size}{
The font size for the labels in the geological scale. The first value in \code{list()} is the font size for geological epochs and the second value is for geological periods. Passed directly to the \code{size} argument of \code{\link[deeptime:coord_geo]{deeptime::coord_geo}}.
}
 \item{geo_skip}{
A vector of interval names indicating which intervals should not be labeled. Passed directly to the \code{skip} argument of \code{\link[deeptime:coord_geo]{deeptime::coord_geo}}.
}
}
\details{
Plots the phylogentic tree contained in \code{tree} using \code{\link[ggtree:ggtree]{ggtree::ggtree}}. Branches undergoing accelerating evolutionary rates (e.g., >\code{"1 SD"}, \code{"3 SD"}, or \code{"5 SD"} relative to the background rate) for each morphological partition suggest directional (or positive) selection for that morphological partition in that branch of the tree. Branches undergoing decelerating evolutionary rates (e.g., <\code{"1 SD"}, \code{"3 SD"}, or \code{"5 SD"} relative to the background rate) for each morphological partition suggest stabilizing selection for that morphological partition in that branch of the tree. For details methods and rationale, see Simões & Pierce (2021).
